        This is at least a partial credits-file of people that have
        contributed to the Linux project.  It is sorted by name and
        formatted to allow easy grepping and beautification by
        scripts.  The fields are: name (N), email (E), web-address
        (W) and description (D).

        Thanks,
                                Manik
