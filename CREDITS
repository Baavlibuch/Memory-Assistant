This is at least a partial credits-file of people that have
contributed to the Linux project.  It is sorted by name and
formatted to allow easy grepping and beautification by
scripts.  The fields are: name (N), email (E), web-address
(W), PGP key ID and fingerprint (P), description (D), and
snail-mail address (S).

Thanks,
