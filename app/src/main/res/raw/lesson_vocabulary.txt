<p>Building vocabulary has never been easier and faster. Just take a elephant path or a wardrobe. Memorise a word at each peg. Memorise the meaning at the same or next peg depending on your preference.</p>

<p>To memorise a new word, just make a story to memorise the order of the syllables. Use another story that matches the meaning.</p>

<p>Revise frequently.</p>
