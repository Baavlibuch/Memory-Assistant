<p>The hardest part of learning a new language is the vocabulary. However, it is just a walk in the park for a memory athlete. Just take a elephant path or a wardrobe. Memorise a word at each peg. Memorise the meaning at the same or next peg depending on your preference.</p>

<p>To memorise a new word, just make a story to memorise the order of the syllables. Use another story that matches the meaning.</p>

<p>To learn a new script, create a story that can represent a character and memorise the pronunciation. That's it.</p>

<p>Once that is done, you can memorize the grammatical rules and exceptions as lists.</p>

<p>Fluency can only be gained by using the language frequently without using your elephant path.</p>
